# gd-SoloVisibility
A godot 4.x plugin that implements https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/9782 using Shift + H to hide all nodes except the selection, and Alt + H to do the inverse.

"Selection" includes all of the selected nodes children. As of version 0.1 this is currently a destructive operation.
